# neuron_spike
Excited to present my latest project: a Python-based simulation of neuron spiking behavior using NumPy and Brain2. It accurately replicates neural communication dynamics, aiding understanding in neuroscience. Modular and educational, it's open for collaboration.#Python #Neuroscience #Simulation #NumPy #Brain2 #Education
